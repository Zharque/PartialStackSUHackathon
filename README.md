Features of MatchPoint

Core Features
	Account - when entering the app, the user can create an applicant account or a business account. The account profile can be further modified such as experience and expertise for applicants and company size, field of business, and etc. for businesses.
	Swipe - the web app will recommend businesses and applicants to each other to see if they are interested in each other. The recommendations will be based on the account details of the user. When a user "swipes" another user, the other user will get notified and they can also check to see if they are interested in them as well. If they are reciprocated, they will be matched.
	Chat - when an applicant and a business are matched, they will gain the ability to chat with each other. This will be a simple chat function where they can use as a steppingstone for more in-depth communication if they choose to, such as email.
High Priority Features
	Account Posts - each account has the ability to post. For applicants, they can post about new certifications they attained, pictures from company events, hanging out with coworkers, etc. For businesses, they can also post about company milestones, events they held, job hirings post, etc.
Future Features
	Company Forums - each company has a forum where its employees can post threads where they can discuss about topics. These posts are visible only to employees from the same company.
